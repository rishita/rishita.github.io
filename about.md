Hi, my name is Rishita Anubhai. I am originally from Ahmedabad, India and I currently live in the San Francisco bay area in the United States. Here, I work at the [Silicon Valley AI Lab (SVAIL), Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/silicon-valley-ai-lab/). I did my undergrad in CS from Nirma University ('11), followed by my Masters in CS from Stanford University ('13).

### Before I met Machine Learning

During my undergrad in India, amongst my interests in information security and AI, I got opportunities to work in the former. I did multiple undergrad internships as a [research intern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishitaa#experience-320906555) in the domain of web security at a startup called [Blueinfy](http://www.blueinfy.com/). Eventually when I started my MS program at Stanford, I initially continued to pursue a specialization in computer and information security in my first year. During this time, I also did some [research under the guidance of Prof. Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/ssl-client-bugs.html) at Stanford.

### First steps in Machine Learning

Having always been fascinated with the field of AI and ML, Stanford was the first time I got the chance to take a course on machine learning at Stanford under Prof. Andrew Ng. This got me very interested and I took various classes such as NLP, NLU, Information Retrieval, Data Mining, etc. through which I could get to work on different [course projects](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishitaa#background-projects) in the domain. I then decided to do a second specialization in ML by sticking around a little longer before graduating from Stanford. During this time, I also worked at the [Shah Lab at Biomedical Informatics Research Institute](http://bmir.stanford.edu/research/shahlab.html) at the Stanford Medical School. Here, I got the opportunity to explore applications of this domain in data driven medicine while working on patient similarity.

### Microsoft

After graduating from Stanford, I went on to work full time at Microsoft Redmond for SQL Azure. There, I joined an incubation project based on statistical machine learning as one of its first members. Initially, I worked on designing a system for statistical anomaly detection in time series data. We also worked on scaling it to support hundreds of time series at near real time. The idea was to enable alerting on system metrics to drive proactive mitigations from these anomalies. I went on to work on detecting and alerting on slow trends in time series data. I presented this work at Microsoft's internal Practice of Machine Learning Conference (PMLC '15).

### Silicon Valley AI Lab (SVAIL) Baidu Research

Microsoft was a great experience with a great team that got me excited about ML research and its productionization. At that stage, some time last year, I was talking to different people to decide if I wanted to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning. During these conversations I learnt about SVAIL at Baidu Research in much greater depth and Prof Ng's vision at the lab. It seemed to be an ideal place that encouraged fundamental learning in the field of AI, ML and deep learning alongside providing research exposure. I was convinced that this was an exciting place where I could learn from some of the most experienced researchers in the domain of deep learning and HPC. In fact, working at the lab would give me a platform to not only explore research but also its product impact given the resources and scale of impact that Baidu technologies already have.

After having joined SVAIL about 8 months back as a machine learning engineer, I have worked on various projects involving [Deep Speech 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595) and its productionization. I have also worked on some initial efforts in natural language understanding and dialog agents at the lab. This experience has been very rewarding and I continue to learn a lot from my colleagues at various paper reading groups and learning sessions at the lab. In future, I keenly wish to further deepen my understanding of deep learning and the intuitions that drive it.

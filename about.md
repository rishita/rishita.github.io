Hi, my name is Rishita Anubhai. I am originally from Ahmedabad, India and I currently live in the San Francisco bay area in the United States. Here, I work at the [Silicon Valley AI Lab (SVAIL), Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/silicon-valley-ai-lab/). I did my undergrad in CS from Nirma University ('11), followed by my Masters in CS from Stanford University ('13).

### Silicon Valley AI Lab (SVAIL) Baidu Research

Some time last year, while working at Microsoft, I was talking to different people to decide if I wanted to pursue a PhD in Machine Learning. During these conversations I learnt more about SVAIL at Baidu Research and Prof. Andrew Ng's vision at the lab. It seemed to be an ideal place that encouraged fundamental learning in the field of AI, ML and deep learning alongside providing research exposure. I could learn from some of the most experienced researchers in the domain of deep learning and HPC. I was convinced that working at the lab would give me a platform to not only explore research but also its product impact given the resources and scale of impact that Baidu technologies already have.

After having joined SVAIL about 8 months back as a machine learning engineer, I have worked on various projects involving [Deep Speech 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02595) and its productionization. I have also worked on some initial efforts in natural language understanding. Specifically, I have worked on the initial efforts on creating conversational dialog agents that can specialize for different domains with minimal re-training. This experience has been very rewarding and I continue to learn a lot from my colleagues at various paper reading groups and learning sessions at the lab. I also take deep learning courses like [CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html) and [CS224D](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) from Stanford in my extra time. The appeal of end to end neural models fascinates me and I keenly wish to further deepen my understanding of deep learning, it's various subtleties and the intuitions that drive it.

### Microsoft

Before SVAIL, I worked full time at Microsoft Redmond for a machine learning focussed incubation team in SQL Azure. I joined the team starting with a project based on statistical machine learning as one of its first members. Initially, I worked on designing a system for statistical anomaly detection in time series data. We also worked on scaling it to support hundreds of time series at near real time. The idea was to enable alerting on system metrics to drive proactive mitigations from these anomalies. I then worked on detecting and alerting on slow trends in time series data. I presented this work at Microsoft's internal Practice of Machine Learning Conference (PMLC '15). I also participated in side projects collaborating with other product teams and machine learning researchers across Microsoft such as building user modeling pipelines and other modules to enhance the Azure Machine Learning platform.

### First steps in Machine Learning

Having always been fascinated with the field of AI and ML, Stanford was the first time I got the chance to take a course on machine learning by Prof. Ng. This got me very interested and I took various classes such as NLP, NLU, Information Retrieval, Data Mining, etc. During this process, I got to work on different [projects](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishitaa#background-projects) in the domain such as event and actor detection on biological texts for question answering, temporal and contextual neural models for rainfall prediction, etc. The math involved, its ties to intuition while developing models and widespread applicability of machine learning led me to complete a specialization in ML (in addition to one in security) by sticking around a little longer before graduating from Stanford. During this time, I also worked at the [Shah Lab at Biomedical Informatics Research Institute](http://bmir.stanford.edu/research/shahlab.html) at the Stanford Medical School. This gave me the opportunity to explore applications of this domain in data driven medicine when I worked on patient similarity models.

### Before I met Machine Learning

During my undergrad in India, amongst my interests in information security and AI, I mainly got opportunities to work in the former. I did multiple undergrad internships as a [research intern](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishitaa#experience-320906555) in the domain of web security at a startup, namely [Blueinfy Solutions Pvt Ltd](http://www.blueinfy.com/). Eventually when I started my MS program at Stanford, I initially continued to pursue a specialization in computer and information security in my first year. During this time, I also did some [research under the guidance of Prof. Dan Boneh](http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/ssl-client-bugs.html) at Stanford. This has given me a good foundation in systems which happens to often help me in my current interest in deep learning.
